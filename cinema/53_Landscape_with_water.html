                This film is influenced by a statement by the British painter Paul Nash which he wrote in the British magazine Country Life in May 1938, about what he called the ‘unseen landscapes’ of England. “The landscapes I have in mind are not part of the unseen world in the psychic sense, nor are they part of the Unconscious. They belong to the world that lies, visibly, about us. They are unseen merely because they are not perceived; only in that way can they be regarded as invisible.”
The upper image is a shot of a landscape where a stream crosses a ford. The images in the sequence below are close-up shots of the surface of the water. The close-up focus removes the context of the surrounding landscape, creating images that are quite abstract in nature.
