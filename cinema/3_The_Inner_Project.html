                The “Inner project” focuses mainly on the director's perception of the world as a female artist on the Autistic spectrum. It's a visual journey of the reflection of the inner world of the artist, which is hidden deep inside, away from society. How it feels to be in the body of an alien that was born on this planet but isn't equipped with the right resources to understand how everything works, who is trying to figure things out and fit in. The invisible language that everyone communicates with is impossible to learn so you exhaust yourself by trying to learn it, trying not to stand out, trying to understand. Still, every time you try you exhaust yourself to the point of your body starts malfunctioning like an overloaded computer that can't process any more information.
