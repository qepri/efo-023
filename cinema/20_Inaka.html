                Inaka is a screendance carried out in an artistic residence in the province of Fukuoka, Japan, during the summer of 2018. This project is an investigation about the spirituality of the human being and its possibility of transcending in a non-physical way in different planes through the movement. Religion is present in the screendance as a symbol of the spiritual part of the human being and the dancer as the physical part. The movement and choreography are synchronized with the religion elements, as a means to transcend to other planes being from the physical to the spiritual. To visually emphasize the different planes, we investigated the religions in Japan and used the locations of the Buddhist and the Shinto religions. The Buddhist religion has as an existential plane, the temple and the Shinto cult has as an existential, plane nature. As an external observer of this different planes, there is an elevated being who watches the existence through water, symbol of the mirror and communicator between the different planes.
